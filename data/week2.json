        "Run",
        "All of these"
      ],
      "answer": "All of these",
      "explanation": "MQTT uses methods like CONNECT, PUBLISH, SUBSCRIBE, and DISCONNECT, but Break, Stick, and Run are not valid MQTT methods. Hence, all the options listed are incorrect."

        "None of these"
      ],
      "answer": "Publish-Subscribe",
      "explanation": "MQTT uses a Publish-Subscribe paradigm where publishers send messages to topics and subscribers receive messages from those topics via a broker. The client-server model is not the core message exchange mechanism here."

      "question": "In MQTT, the Subscribers are Lightweight Sensors.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"

      "options": [
        "False",
        "True"
      ],
      "answer": "False",
      "explanation": "Topics in MQTT are UTF-8 strings that can include letters, numbers, and symbols. They are used for message routing between publishers and subscribers."

        "Sound",
        "None of these"
      ],
      "answer": "Event",
      "explanation": "MQTT is event-driven: messages are published to a topic whenever a relevant event occurs, and subscribers receive these messages asynchronously."
    },
    {
      "question": "The topic is the routing information for the broker.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
