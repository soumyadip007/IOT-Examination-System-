          "Message Query Telemetry Transport",
          "Message Queue Telemedicine Transport",
          "None of these"
        ],
        "answer": "None of these",
        "explanation": "The correct full form of MQTT is Message Queuing Telemetry Transport, not any of the options listed. It is a lightweight messaging protocol used in IoT for reliable communication."

        "question": "Which of the following is NOT a method in MQTT?",
        "options": [
          "Break",
          "Stick",
          "Run",
          "All of these"
        ],
        "answer": "All of these",
        "explanation": "MQTT uses methods like CONNECT, PUBLISH, SUBSCRIBE, and DISCONNECT, but Break, Stick, and Run are not valid MQTT methods. Hence, all the options listed are incorrect."

        "answer": "All of these",
        "explanation": "MQTT consists of Publishers (send messages), Subscribers (receive messages), and Brokers (manage message distribution). All three are essential components of the MQTT architecture."

          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "False",
        "explanation": "SMQTT is not a widely standardized extension of MQTT with three main stages; the statement about lightweight attribute-based encryption and three stages is incorrect. MQTT security is generally handled via TLS or other mechanisms."

          "None of these"
        ],
        "answer": "None of these",
        "explanation": "The two sub-layers of CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) are Messaging and Request/Response. None of the options listed match the correct sub-layers."

          "None of these"
        ],
        "answer": "None of these",
        "explanation": "The correct full form of AMQP is Advanced Message Queuing Protocol, a messaging protocol used for reliable communication in IoT and other distributed systems."

      {
        "question": "XMPP uses the …………. architecture.",
        "options": [
          "Publish-subscribe",

          "Both (a) and (b)",
          "Neither (a) nor (b)"
        ],
        "answer": "Client-server",
        "explanation": "XMPP primarily uses a client-server architecture, where clients communicate through servers to exchange messages and presence information. The publish-subscribe model is an optional extension, not the core architecture."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many message delivery guarantee modes are there in the AMQP protocol?",
        "options": [
          "2",
          "3",
          "4",
          "None of these"
        ],
        "answer": "3",
        "explanation": "AMQP provides three message delivery guarantee modes: At most once, At least once, and Exactly once, ensuring different levels of reliability in message delivery."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which of the following is/are NOT an AMQP frame type?",

        "answer": "False",
        "explanation": "IEEE 802.15.5 is actually the standard for wireless mesh networks, not specifically for low data rate monitoring or extended-life low power communication. That description fits IEEE 802.15.4 instead."

        "question": "The IEEE 802.15.4 operates in ISM band.",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "True",
        "explanation": "IEEE 802.15.4 is the standard for low-rate wireless personal area networks, which forms the basis for protocols like Zigbee. It is specifically designed to operate in the unlicensed ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical) radio bands, such as 2.4 GHz, 915 MHz, and 868 MHz."

          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer": "True",
        "explanation": "The LOADng (LLN On-demand Ad hoc Distance-vector routing protocol next generation) protocol is a reactive routing protocol. A router generates and broadcasts Route Requests (RREQs) when it needs a route to a destination — a key mechanism for on-demand route discovery."
